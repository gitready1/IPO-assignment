|How do I get to the bathroom?|
|		    |Listen to the question and think about an answer|
|		    |Determine the manner and tone to use to communicate with the person asking the question.|
|		    |Check your mood|
|		    |If you are in a goood mood|
|		    |                                        |
|                   |If you are in a good mood|
|                   |                         |              |Don't smile, but try not to be rude||

|                   |                                        |Don't smile, but try not to be rude|
|                   |                                        |
|
|		    |Determine where the bathroom is in relation to your current location|
|	            |Determine the level of specificity the person asking the question will need-should I ask them to count steps, or will vague directions be enough? Tailor your output to the desired audience.|
